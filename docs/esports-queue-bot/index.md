# Esports Queue Bot

The queue bot is designed to help you find game matches with players of similar skill level. This bot will allow you to set your rank for a game and game type, add yourself to a queue, and get notified when a player of a similar level queues up.

> [!NOTE]
> The prefix for this bot is `eq!`, so to call the help command you would use `eq!help`.

> [!TIP]
> If you are looking to start using this bot to find matches, begin with the `init` command. Then, use the `stats` command to set your rank, and finally the `queue` command to join a queue.
