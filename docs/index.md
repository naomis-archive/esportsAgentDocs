This website serves as documentation for the Esports Agent Bot and Esports Queue Bot. Both bots can be found in [the Discord server](https://discord.gg/GB2HqBpvf9).

This bot posts friendly reminders to the community for the Admin team. If you see a message from this bot, it's important information you want to read carefully.

## Esports Queue Bot

This bot will allow you to register your rankings for supported games, then join the queue for supported game modes and be notified when a player of similar skill has also joined.
